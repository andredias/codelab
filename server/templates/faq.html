        <dl class="faq">

            <dt>What is Code Lab?</dt>
            <dd>Code Lab is an online compiler and lint tool which allows you to run,
                improve and share your code using several programming languages.</dd>

            <dt>Are there any memory or time constraints for the submitted programs?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, they are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>compilation time: 10 seconds,</li>
                    <li>execution time: 5 seconds (for not logged in users) or 15 seconds (for registered users),</li>
                    <li>memory usage: 256 MiB.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>Can I access the Internet from my program?</dt>
            <dd>No, access to the network is blocked.</dd>

            <dt>Can I write or read files in my program?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, but there is an 1 MiB limit of disk space.</dd>

            <dt>How long my codes will be stored on Code Lab?</dt>
            <dd>6 months</dd>

            <dt>What is the size limit for the source code, input and output?</dt>
            <dd>128 KiB</dd>

            <dt>How many processes can I create in my program?</dt>
            <dd>Programs are allowed to create up to 15 processes. It means, for example, that you can use together up to 14 pipelines in the Bash.</dd>

            <dt>What encoding is used in the source code and in the input stream?</dt>
            <dd>UTF-8</dd>

            <dt>How is end of line (EOL) represented in the source code and in the input stream?</dt>
            <dd>
                <em>End of line</em> is represented by <code>\n</code> (LF, Linux style).
                Even if you submit input or source code with Windows EOL (<code>\r\n</code>, CRLF)
                or Mac OS EOL (<code>\r</code>, CR), end-of-lines will be converted to the Linux style.
            </dd>

            <dt>My program seems to have a correct syntax. Why does it fail to execute?</dt>
            <dd>
                Be sure to place "main" class/program/module/function/procedure in your code
                (<a href="/samples">here you will find a sample</a> for every language).
            </dd>

            <dt>I would like to see a new language or library on Code Lab. Is there anything I can do about that?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, please <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="openModalDialog('/contact')">contact us</a>.</dd>

        {#
            <dt>How can I get in touch with you?</dt>
            <dd>Follow us on Twitter.</dd>
